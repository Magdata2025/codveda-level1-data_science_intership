# Level 2 – Task 1: Predictive Modeling (Regression)

## Objective
Build and evaluate regression models to predict a continuous variable
using real-world housing data.

## Dataset
- house Prediction Data Set.csv

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Feature encoding and scaling
3. Train-test split
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation using MSE and R²
6. Performance comparison

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Outcome
Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance in terms of
prediction accuracy and robustness.
